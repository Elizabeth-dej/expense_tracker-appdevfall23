## Project Roadmap – Codebase Exploration

After reviewing the command-line Expense Tracker application, I observed that it is designed to help users manage their spending by allowing them to add, edit, delete, view, and save expense records. The interface runs entirely in the terminal, using a menu system powered by a main loop that continuously prompts the user for actions until they choose to exit.

The code is written in Python and is organized into separate functions, each responsible for a specific task. For example, there are dedicated functions for adding expenses, saving them to a CSV file, and editing or deleting existing entries. All expense records are stored in a list of dictionaries and saved using Python’s built-in `csv` module. The application also includes a feature that generates a pie chart using Matplotlib to visually summarize expenses by category, which I found to be a useful way of translating raw data into insights.

Overall, the code demonstrates a clear and modular structure. It uses conditionals, loops, and error handling to guide the user through a smooth interaction process. This structure helped me understand how to build a complete terminal-based application that handles input, stores data, and produces meaningful output through both text and visuals.
